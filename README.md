# Keylogger
A Python based KeyLogger that can access key strokes from your pc.

I made my first ever Cyber Security project with a basic KeyLogger that can access keystrokes from a targeted pc.

Here I’ve used the pynput library to detect the keystrokes from the user after that I am taking all the strokes in a .txt file, here it’s named log.txt. 

If you go through the code you can see I’ve used two different functions one is for collecting the keystrokes from the keyboard and the other is for deploying them in that log.txt file. 

And with that method, I’ve created a base-level KeyLogger that I can run on any targated machine and capture the keystroke input from the user.

It’s a python program that I’ve to run on the targeted machine, so that is why I’m trying to make a .exe file of that program that I can install on the targeted machine and capture keystrokes for various purposes from anywhere in the world.

Also, in that case, I want to mention that this program is purely built for experience purpose and project purposes. I’ve tried the whole thing on my local machine only. Not any other machine is harmed.
